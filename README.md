## 📜 About the Project

EduNest is a simple yet powerful **notes sharing platform** built specially for **college students**.  
The idea came from my own experience — at the start of every semester, my friends and I would create Google Drive folders to share notes.  
While it worked, it often became messy and unorganized.  
That’s when I thought, *why not create a dedicated platform where students can easily upload, download, and browse each other’s notes in one place?*

With EduNest, any registered student can:
- 📤 **Upload** their study material in just a few clicks.
- 📥 **Browse and download** notes uploaded by others.
- 📚 **Access shared resources anytime** without digging through multiple links.

I developed this project **completely on my own** as a **major project for my placements**.  
Before starting EduNest, I had **no prior knowledge of backend technologies**.  
This project became my **project-based learning journey** — by the end, I gained solid experience in:
- Building secure APIs
- Handling file uploads
- Managing a database
- Implementing user authentication

EduNest is not just a project for me — it’s a **personal milestone** that turned a real-life problem into a working solution,  
while helping me grow as a **full-stack developer**.
