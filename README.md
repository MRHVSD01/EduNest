ðŸ“œ About the Project
EduNest is a simple yet powerful notes sharing platform built specially for college students. The idea came from my own experience â€” at the start of every semester, my friends and I would create Google Drive folders to share notes. While it worked, it often became messy and unorganized. Thatâ€™s when I thought, why not create a dedicated platform where students can easily upload, download, and browse each otherâ€™s notes in one place?

With EduNest, any registered student can:

Upload their study material in just a few clicks.

Browse and download notes uploaded by others.

Access shared resources anytime without digging through multiple links.

I developed this project completely on my own as a major project for my placements. Before starting EduNest, I had no prior knowledge of backend technologies. This project became my project-based learning journey â€” by the end, I gained solid experience in building secure APIs, handling file uploads, managing a database, and implementing user authentication.

EduNest is not just a project for me â€” itâ€™s a personal milestone that turned a real-life problem into a working solution, while helping me grow as a full-stack developer.
